# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
This simple note-taking app was created for an assignment. The public facing files were not completed by me, those were provided to me. The back-end of the app utilizes express to properly get and post data to the server. 


## Use
To use this app, it needs to be deployed through a server. Once deployed, a user can click the main button to take them to the notes page. There, they will be able to create and view notes that they have saved. There is not yet the ability to delete notes, as that was a bonus feature that I did not have time to finish. 

## Collaborators and tech stack
I recieved assistance from tutors Sandy Smith, Brandon Rose, and Andrew Hardemon, as well as guidance from TAs in my bootcamp course. To complete this project, I used node.js express and javascript.
